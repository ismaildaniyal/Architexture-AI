ArchiTexture: Linguistic-Driven 3D House Plan Generator
ArchiTexture is a platform designed to automate the process of architectural design by converting natural language descriptions into detailed 2D and 3D floor plans. Utilizing advancements in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, ArchiTexture allows users to input descriptions in simple language and generate accurate architectural layouts, bridging the gap between intent and architectural output.


Introduction
ArchiTexture simplifies architectural design by translating textual descriptions into structured 2D and 3D layouts. This tool serves architects, real estate professionals, game developers, and even non-experts, making design faster, accessible, and more precise.
